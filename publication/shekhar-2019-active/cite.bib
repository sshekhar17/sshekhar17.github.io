 abstract = {We construct and analyze active learning algorithms for the problem of binary classification
with abstention. We consider three abstention settings: fixed-cost and two variants of boundedrate abstention, and for each of them propose an active learning algorithm. All the proposed
algorithms can work in the most commonly used active learning models, i.e., membership-query,
pool-based, and stream-based sampling. We obtain upper-bounds on the excess risk of our
algorithms in a general non-parametric framework, and establish their minimax near-optimality
by deriving matching lower-bounds. Since our algorithms rely on the knowledge of some
smoothness parameters of the regression function, we then describe a new strategy to adapt
to these unknown parameters in a data-driven manner. Since the worst case computational
complexity of our proposed algorithms increases exponentially with the dimension of the
input space, we conclude the paper with a computationally efficient variant of our algorithm
whose computational complexity has a polynomial dependence over a smaller but rich class of
learning problems},
